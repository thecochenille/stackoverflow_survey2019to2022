# Udacity Blog project using Stackoverflow surveys 2022
# Draw me a Data Scientist

Hi! 

Using the Stack Overflow Survey from 2022, I asked the following questions:

- Question 1: What programming languages do data science people work with and what should I focus on if I pick a DS role?
- Question 2: What programming languages and cloud platforms are in demand?
- Question 3: How well are Data Science roles paid in the US?

# Udacity Blog project using Stackoverflow surveys 2022
# Draw me a Data Scientist

*Data Science once an emerging field is now in high demand* in companies trying to build Data Science (DS) teams or hiring DS professionals to provide data supported insights and solutions for these companies. What does a data science role look like today?
To answer this questions, I used the CRISP-DM process, a methodology routinely used in Data Science projects.


## Business Understanding
The main questions I asked to draw a picture of a data science professionals were the following:

- **Question 1**: What programming languages do data science people work with and what should I focus on if I pick a DS role?
- **Question 2**: What programming languages and cloud platforms are in demand?
- **Question 3**: How well are Data Science roles paid in the US?


## Data Understanding
To answer these questions, I used the Stack Overflow Survey from 2022 and focused on responses provided by Data Science roles.

## Data Preparation and Evaluation
The analysis was done using Python, you can find the full [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/thecochenille/stackoverflow_survey2022_CRISP-DM/blob/f93d9c776697e840039d1522da2433b128f58ee9/Stackoverflow_survey2022Analysis.ipynb).
